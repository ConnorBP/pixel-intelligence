As we worked on the Pixel Intelligence project, everything is going according to the initial planning. However, I changed the layout of the gallery page. The original design wasn’t as user-friendly as we wanted, so I decided to change it to something that looks better and works more smoothly. This new layout makes the page more visually appealing and easier to use.

While working on the gallery, I faced a few challenges. One issue was figuring out how to pass props from parent components to child components properly. It took some time to understand the flow of data and adjust the code so everything worked correctly. Another challenge was setting up the routes for the image detail overlay window. It was tricky to make sure the overlay opened and closed without affecting the rest of the gallery, but after some problem-solving, it worked as expected.

Right now, the project is moving along well. Our progress has been good. Connor helped a lot by creating detailed GitHub issues for each task and dividing the work among the team. This made it easier for everyone to stay focused and know what to do next.

Overall, we’ve made some changes along the way, but the project is going well.
