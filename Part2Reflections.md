The project has been progressing well. We are all doing our best to implement the key featrure of the project. Connor announced the issues we needed to address, and everyone could choose the tasks they wanted to work on. I chose to work on designing and coding on frontend on the "Create New Image" and "Save Image" popups. These popups are an important part of the user interface, allowing users to name and describe their images and select canvas sizes.
One of the challenges I faced was to make sure the design and functionality of the popups fit well with the overall theme of the project. I tried to ensure everything matched the pixel-art style while remaining user-friendly was not easy. However, it was interesting work, I enjoyed creating features like the canvas size selection and input fields. Currently, the popups are functional, but some features still need improvement, such as the image preview, which is not yet fully working. I will continue to work on this and collaborate with team members to ensure the popups integrate smoothly with the generative AI functionality and the gallery view. I am also working on styling the gallery to make it visually appealing and user-friendly, with a clean layout and responsive design that fits the overall theme of the project.
