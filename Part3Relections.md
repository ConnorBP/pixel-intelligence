â€‹In part 3 of this project the gallery page needed to efficiently handle large numbers of images. In this regard, I implemented a pagination API so that images are loaded in manageable chunks, hence improving performance and usability. This API allows the frontend to request a specific page of images from the backend, hence reducing the load on the server and improving the overall user experience. I designed the API to carefully accept parameters, such as the current page number and the number of images per page, to be flexible in the way images could be displayed. Then the backend processes these requests for a set of images to be returned and displays them on the gallery page.

I'm also working on the development of the Image Generation API, which is supposed to create a pixel art image according to the input or prompts of users. I found it a bit complicated task in the starting but after doing some google search and watching some tutorials on YouTube I think that I can do it finally.

Overall, the progress of the Pixel Intelligence project has been great, and everything is going as planned. All team members are contributing to the project, thus enabling the efficient completion of all tasks at the right time. The collaboration has been smooth, with everyone working to achieve our goals in this project.
