# Steps to use app
open [https://229-pixelai.netlify.app](https://229-pixelai.netlify.app) in your desktop or mobile browser, feel free to browse the gallery listing pages and click on any image to view it. Then you may download, share, or even edit that photo with the provided options on the popup. If you click edit it will bring you to the editor and ask if you want to overwrite the current canvas. You can also get to the editor from the top bar. Once in the editor you will see all your document options in the top buttons or context menu, and all drawing tools on the left. In the top right there is also a shortcut to the gallery on desktop mode, or on mobile it is in the context menu. You may now draw with your cursor or finger, or click on the + icon to generate a new ai image to start with. Once you have an image you like you can download it in json form or in png form with the top buttons, then you can import it again later. On the top right of the buttons is also a share option to share your image on the front page gallery.

**My Experience:**

​	This project was sort of intense, but it was very fun. I am very tired and have seen many of javascript's types of bugs at this point. There's still more stuff that can be extended on the program to make it even cooler, but I am quite happy with the feature set and code quality that we got it to for presentation day. Pixel art image scaling works flawlessly, the ai generator makes really cool stuff and is fairly responsive (although the progress bar's prediction code needs some adjustment), the whole data backend in the webapp is page reload resistant in its state management so that users don't loose their in progress drawings or image generation requests, the gallery pagination and gallery viewer and sharing works great, the image caching system is fast and accurate, and the existing drawing features are robust. We didn't end up adding a lot of the fun stretch goals to this because instead the focus was on making what was already there as solid as possible such as the fill bucket algorithm, drawing interpolation, the reload resistant image generation lifecycle (state machine of idle, sending request, waiting, failed, done, etc), making the components more composable (such as the ConfirmationPopup), implementing custom hooks, and many other things to make this app run great and be a good basis for further extensions. Over all I am very happy with the result, and hope to keep this project alive for the foreseeable future as it is just so neat. I would like to specially thank Sanjeev Chauhan for diving in head first into some of the more complicated tasks like the image generation and pagination api backend. I had some big tasks on my plate already, so the fact that he was willing to get his hands dirty on some big tasks really helped make this project possible. I would also like to thank Parmila Shams for their popup component designs and Yoon Min for wrangling the extended editor tooling.
