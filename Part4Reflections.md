When I started to work on this project I did not much about the React and how the backend works behind the UI. After spending so much time doing this project it help me a lot to learn so many things about React and how the components in react works. Additionally, when I started to work on the image generation api endpoints it seem really hard in the beginning but after discussing with my team member Connor his explanation really helped me to think through the solution to how to make the api work. Finally, just before an hour before our group presentation I found a small CSS error I can say and I also implemented the image creation cancellation button but We forgot to merge the branch to the main thanks to the a person, he will probably know I'm talking about him if he reads this 😂. Anyways, it was quite fun to work on this project and with the contribution and collaboration of our group members we were able to finish thi. So Kudos to every group members🎉🎉🍾. We do have many stretch goals for this application and will work on that also but for now, at least for today, we are done😁. Lol I wrote a quite a bit without noticing. XD
