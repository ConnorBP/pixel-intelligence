### Yoon Min(301317593) - Github: superYM222

This was my first time participating in a project like this. This project taught me how to share code with others using GitHub. In addition, if Conner finds bugs, he uploaded to the GitHub issue page, we can assign them to ourselves to ensure without duplication. At first, GitHub seemed very challenging, but I learned a lot by making many mistakes. I learned about React, and working with multiple pages simultaneously was difficult. However, by looking at other people's code, I realized there are many different ways to implement things. Also, I worked on fixing bugs and improving editors in the features of the left toolbar. one of the issues was with the eyedropper tool—it worked on Chrome but wasn’t supported in Safari or mobile. To address this, I added an HTML color picker feature. I also tried to add a gridLine on/off button, but Connor fixed my code, and I learned how to simplify it and make it more reusable from his code. Additionally, I attempted functionality to close a window when clicking the mouse on the background or pressing the ESC key. However, I faced a warning and couldn’t resolve it. The issue seems to be related to breaking a React rule.
