# Steps to use app
open [https://229-pixelai.netlify.app](https://229-pixelai.netlify.app) in your desktop or mobile browser, feel free to browse the gallery listing pages and click on any image to view it. Then you may download, share, or even edit that photo with the provided options on the popup. If you click edit it will bring you to the editor and ask if you want to overwrite the current canvas. You can also get to the editor from the top bar. Once in the editor you will see all your document options in the top buttons or context menu, and all drawing tools on the left. In the top right there is also a shortcut to the gallery on desktop mode, or on mobile it is in the context menu. You may now draw with your cursor or finger, or click on the + icon to generate a new ai image to start with. Once you have an image you like you can download it in json form or in png form with the top buttons, then you can import it again later. On the top right of the buttons is also a share option to share your image on the front page gallery.

### Connor "ConnorBP" Postma (301005412)

‚Äã	This project was sort of intense, but it was very fun. I am very tired and have seen many of javascript's types of bugs at this point. There's still more stuff that can be extended on the program to make it even cooler, but I am quite happy with the feature set and code quality that we got it to for presentation day. Pixel art image scaling works flawlessly, the ai generator makes really cool stuff and is fairly responsive (although the progress bar's prediction code needs some adjustment), the whole data backend in the webapp is page reload resistant in its state management so that users don't loose their in progress drawings or image generation requests, the gallery pagination and gallery viewer and sharing works great, the image caching system is fast and accurate, and the existing drawing features are robust. We didn't end up adding a lot of the fun stretch goals to this because instead the focus was on making what was already there as solid as possible such as the fill bucket algorithm, drawing interpolation, the reload resistant image generation lifecycle (state machine of idle, sending request, waiting, failed, done, etc), making the components more composable (such as the ConfirmationPopup), implementing custom hooks, and many other things to make this app run great and be a good basis for further extensions. Over all I am very happy with the result, and hope to keep this project alive for the foreseeable future as it is just so neat. I would like to specially thank Sanjeev Chauhan for diving in head first into some of the more complicated tasks like the image generation and pagination api backend. I had some big tasks on my plate already, so the fact that he was willing to get his hands dirty on some big tasks really helped make this project possible. I would also like to thank Parmila Shams for their popup component designs and Yoon Min for wrangling the extended editor tooling. This project has helped me a lot with my collaboration skills i think, and it sort of brought me back to when I was new to coding and the sorts of things I didn't really know yet. Guiding my team through technical issues and showing different ways of approaching a problem or code design has been a learning experience for sure. I established fairly rigid standards in code review during this project, which may have made some of the tasks take a little longer, but I hope we have all come away from this a little stronger in our coding skills. :) Thanks for your hard work everyone!


### Sanjeevkumar "sanjeev-cs" Chauhan (301480021)

When I started to work on this project I did not much about the React and how the backend works behind the UI. After spending so much time doing this project it help me a lot to learn so many things about React and how the components in react works. Additionally, when I started to work on the image generation api endpoints it seem really hard in the beginning but after discussing with my team member Connor his explanation really helped me to think through the solution to how to make the api work. Finally, just before an hour before our group presentation I found a small CSS error I can say and I also implemented the image creation cancellation button but We forgot to merge the branch to the main thanks to the a person, he will probably know I'm talking about him if he reads this üòÇ. Anyways, it was quite fun to work on this project and with the contribution and collaboration of our group members we were able to finish thi. So Kudos to every group membersüéâüéâüçæ. We do have many stretch goals for this application and will work on that also but for now, at least for today, we are doneüòÅ. Lol I wrote quite a bit without noticing. XD

### Yoon Min(301317593) - Github: superYM222

This was my first time participating in a project like this. This project taught me how to share code with others using GitHub. In addition, if Conner finds bugs, he uploaded to the GitHub issue page, we can assign them to ourselves to ensure without duplication. At first, GitHub seemed very challenging, but I learned a lot by making many mistakes. I learned about React, and working with multiple pages simultaneously was difficult. However, by looking at other people's code, I realized there are many different ways to implement things. Also, I worked on fixing bugs and improving editors in the features of the left toolbar. one of the issues was with the eyedropper tool‚Äîit worked on Chrome but wasn‚Äôt supported in Safari or mobile. To address this, I added an HTML color picker feature. I also tried to add a gridLine on/off button, but Connor fixed my code, and I learned how to simplify it and make it more reusable from his code. Additionally, I attempted functionality to close a window when clicking the mouse on the background or pressing the ESC key. However, I faced a warning and couldn‚Äôt resolve it. The issue seems to be related to breaking a React rule.
