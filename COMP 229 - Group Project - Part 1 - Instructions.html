		<h1>COMP229 - Final Project - Part 1: Requirements</h1>
		<p><em>Note: Students often ask how detailed they need to be. There is guidance below, but the best way to think
				about it is not as an assignment but as actual requirements that you will use to help everyone on your
				team communicate effectively. Any minute you spend doing requirements or wireframes now will save you
				2-3 minutes of coding. So, detail is good for you!</em></p>
		<p><em>Note 2:&#160;Another key point is that I want to ensure the project is the right level of challenge for
				you. It should push you to learn and grow but still be achievable within the given timeline and with
				your current skills. Choosing features that are challenging but doable will help you get the most out of
				this project and feel
				<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>proud</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>
				of what you’ve accomplished.</em></p>
		<p>For this first part of your group project, your task is to define the requirements for your MERN application,
			which includes gathering the necessary details to fully scope out your project. You will need to document
			both the technical aspects and user experiences you aim to provide. The requirements section should cover
			the following components:</p>
		<h3><strong>Project Requirements</strong></h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Technology Stack</strong>: You must use React, Node, and a database of your choice.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Challenge Level</strong>: Select a project scope that will be challenging yet achievable for
					you and your team.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Portfolio Focus</strong>: Build your project in a way that makes it suitable for your
					professional portfolio. If you use it in your portfolio, make sure to outline your specific
					contributions.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Interest Driven</strong>: Choose something that you find interesting and are passionate
					about! If you find it interesting, you’ll stay motivated to keep coding, which is the ultimate goal!
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3><strong>Project Breakdown</strong></h3>
		<p><strong>Functional Requirements (30%)</strong></p>
		<p>List all the features that you plan to build here. Make sure to include both the required features and any
			stretch goals you want to attempt. Being detailed about all the features will help ensure you understand the
			full scope of your project and will guide your development later on.</p>
		<p>Label all your features as either <strong>Required</strong> or <strong>Stretch Goal</strong>.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Required Features</strong>: These are the core functionalities that must be completed to
					ensure the application is fully functional. Think of these as the essential features that provide
					the core functionality of the application.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Stretch Goals</strong>: These are additional features that would enhance the application but
					are not essential for it to be functional. Attempt these features if you want to push your learning
					and if time permits.</p>
				<p> </p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>User Stories and Use Cases (30%)</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Write user stories that describe the features from the user perspective.</li>
			<li>Develop use cases that outline the steps users will take to interact with the application and what they
				can expect as a result.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Wireframes (40%)</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Create wireframes for <strong>all</strong> major screens of your application, ensuring that they show
				the layout, navigation, and key interactions for each screen. These should represent the visual
				structure of the app and help guide your development.</li>
			<li>Example: <a rel="noopener"
					href="https://balsamiq.com/learn/articles/what-are-wireframes/#what-are-wireframes-all-about">Here
					is a good read on wireframes with some examples</a></li>
			<li>Tools like Figma, Balsamiq, or even an image editor like Paint can be used to create wireframes. </li>
		</ul>
		<h3><strong>Examples</strong></h3>
		<p><strong>Todo List App Example</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Functional Requirement (Required)</strong>: The application must allow users to create, read,
					update, and delete (CRUD) their tasks. Each task must include a title and due date.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Functional Requirement (Stretch Goal)</strong>: Users should be able to categorize tasks by
					labels or tags and filter the task list based on these categories.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>User Stories</strong>:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>“As a user, I want to be able to add a new task so that I can keep track of my to-dos.”</li>
					<li>“As a user, I want to mark tasks as complete so that I can easily see what I have accomplished.”
					</li>
					<li>“As a user, I want to filter my tasks by category so that I can focus on specific areas of my
						to-do list.”</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Use Case</strong>:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Title</strong>: Adding a New Task</li>
					<li><strong>Actor</strong>: User</li>
					<li><strong>Description</strong>: The user opens the app, navigates to the ‘Add Task’ screen, enters
						a task title and due date, and then clicks the ‘Save’ button. The system confirms the task has
						been added successfully and displays it in the task list.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3><strong>Deliverables</strong></h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Requirements Document</strong>: Create a comprehensive document covering all the functional
				requirements, user stories, and use cases.</li>
			<li><strong>Wireframes</strong>: Submit wireframes for the core screens of your application.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3><strong>Submission Details</strong></h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Submission Date</strong>: November 17 at 11:59pm, no extensions.</li>
			<li><strong>Submission Instructions</strong>: One person from your group can submit the assignment, but in
				the submission message, please include all group members’ legal names and student IDs so that marks can
				be assigned to everyone.</li>
		</ul>
